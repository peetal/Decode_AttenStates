The notebook performed connectivity density analyses reported in Figure 4 of the manuscript. To go through the notebook, please download the data from OSF (see data folder for details). Specifically, the notebook includes
- Group-level differences between cognitive states for each cluster-pair;
- Circos plots and polar plots of each cluster's background FC connectivity patterns; 
- Statistics on intra- and inter- functional community background FC density analyses.
